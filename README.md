About This Project

This is my first assignment from Hyperskill, designed to introduce me to Java programming and project-based learning. The goal is to create a practical tool for small business accounting that could be used for real-world income calculations.

What It Does

The program:
Displays earnings from different products (Bubblegum, Toffee, Ice cream, etc.)
Shows total monthly income ($5,405)
Prompts user to input staff expenses
Prompts user to input other business expenses
Calculates and displays the final net income
